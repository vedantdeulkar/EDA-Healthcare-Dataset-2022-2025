# EDA — Healthcare Dataset (2022–2025)
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Healthcare Data (2022–2025) to analyze patient demographics, hospital utilization, treatments, costs, and outcomes. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization to uncover trends and actionable healthcare insights using Python.
# 🩺 Introduction
With the increasing adoption of digital health systems and electronic health records (EHRs), healthcare organizations generate vast amounts of data related to patients, treatments, hospital operations, and outcomes. Analyzing this data is essential for improving patient care quality, operational efficiency, and cost management.
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on a healthcare dataset spanning 2022 to 2025. The analysis aims to identify patterns in patient demographics, admission trends, treatment types, length of stay, and healthcare costs, as well as factors influencing patient outcomes. The insights generated can assist healthcare administrators, clinicians, and policy makers in making data-driven decisions.

# 📑 Report Structure
1. Data Overview – Provides an overview of the healthcare dataset, including data source, number of records and features, description of key variables, and initial observations.

2. Data Preprocessing – Covers data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicate records, correcting data types, standardizing formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis and feature engineering.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis – Includes statistical analysis and visualizations to examine relationships among variables such as age, gender, diagnosis, treatment type, length of stay, and cost. This section highlights major trends, patterns, and anomalies.

4. Conclusion – Summarizes the key findings and insights obtained from the healthcare EDA and feature engineering process.

5. Recommendations – Provides actionable recommendations to improve patient outcomes, hospital efficiency, and cost optimization based on analytical findings.
